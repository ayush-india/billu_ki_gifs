# emoteJAM

`emoteJAM` is a simple website that generates animated [BTTV](https://betterttv.com/) emotes from static images.

That idea is to apply a well established "meme meta filters" to static emotes. Such as [JAM](https://betterttv.com/emotes/5b77ac3af7bddc567b1d5fb2), [Hop](https://betterttv.com/emotes/5a9578d6dcf3205f57ba294f), etc.

The most important feature of the website is that it's completely client-side and can be easily deployed to something like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) to animate static images and [gif.js](https://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/) to generate actual GIF files inside of your browser.


## Running Locally

Nothing particularly special is required. Just serve the folder using HTTP server like Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

```console
$ python3 -m http.server 6969
$ iexplore.exe http://localhost:6969/
```

## Building

The whole build is organized so you can just serve the repo via an HTTP server and it just works. This is done to simplify deployment to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). We just tell GitHub to service this repo as is. The build artifacts are also commited to the repo. So if you want to simply get the website working you don't even have to build anything. Just serve the repo.

The build is done via the [./build.js](./build.js) script. It is recommended to read it to get an idea on how it works. It is also recommended to check the `"scripts"` section of [./package.json](./package.json) to get an idea on how it is called from `npm run`.

Before doing any building make sure you installed all the necessary dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

To build all the artifacts

```console
$ npm run build
```

## Watching

The [./build.js](./build.js) script enables you to  [Watch](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/configuring-watch.html#handbook-content) the source code:

```console
$ npm run watch
```

## Serving and Watching

```console
$ npm run service
```

This starts both `python3 -m http.server 6969` and [Watching](#Watching) at the same time, providing a convenient development environment.

# Filter Development
